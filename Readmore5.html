			<p> I was 13 when I first wondered what it was like to be a hot woman. 
			<br>Waist, arms, thighs, ass, all the right size.
			<p>To walk in to a room and command attention
			<br>Heads turning in awe.
			<p>I was 14 when I was first called hot.
			<br>Took me 6 years to believe him. 
			<p>No. Actually it took me 4 to pretend to believe him.
			<p>I was 15 when I first felt that my breasts could see light. That I can look at the mirror for more than five minutes.
			<br>I was 16 when I first watched NipTuck, wondering how much money I'd have to collect to get a surgery.
			<br>I was 17 when lost 15 kilos in 3 months. I was wondering how much more do I need to lose to blend in. I knew I would never be hot. So I found a new objective.
			<br>I was 18 when I first started to wondering what it was like to look like a normal girl. A typical girl. Unnoticed. Blending in to pictures of all other girlfriends, in pictures.
			<br>I was 19 when I first started counting the stretch marks. I was standing next to my dancer friend, in front of the mirror complaining about gaining a few kilos.
				She looked the same to me. She said she feels fat. That though she is not clinically over weight that she is fat. She spat the word out like it was poison.
				She looked normal to me. Like any other girl. Average. Hot body. Blending in to the background with all my other girls. In the same breath of body shaming herself, she told my overweight body that I was not fat. She lied to me because deep down she wanted me to feel thin. To feel normal. Because she thought fat was an insult.
				I walked home hoping to lose weight and wondering whether my body was offensive to those around me.
				Like I needed permission to exist cause I occupy more space.
			<p>Same day, a boy in the bus screamed at me saying Whale. 
			<br>Same week boy on the road whistled at me saying Big Mama. 
			<br>Same month a boy on the phone said he has a fat fetish. I wondered if all I am is a fetish. I wondered if that's what hot is for girls that looked like me. Whether I was a BBW.
			<p> I was 20 when I wondered if I should post pictures with my best friends on my Tinder. I wondered if they'd be disappointed to find out that I wasn't the hot one. That I was the fat friend.
			<br>I am 21 now and still over weight.
				But now I know that fat and normal isn't the same thing. I know that thin girls don't feel hot too.
				I still wonder what it's like to be average. I have learned to make fat and hot mutually exclusive the same way I made beautiful and human and girl a threesome.
				I realised that my body demands attention and care even when I want to blend in to a crowd in a picture. When my body walks in heels that eyes will turn and jaws will drop. Either in my beauty, confidence or the durability of my thin tall heels.
			<p>My body decided that others perception of hot isn't my fetish. That I will be sexy with the lights on.
				My body isn't fat enough to be on the biggest loser but isn't thin enough to be a plus size model.
				But my body decided that whales are majestic. That big means that I have more to offer, more to hold on to.
				My body still wonders what it's like to wake up as hot. 
				But on some nights, my body doesn't wonder what it's like..cause my body already knows.
			<p><b>Just that my body sometimes forgets.</b>
