		<body> <h1> To the man who broke my heart </h1>
		<p> Dear Dad,
		<p> I've got so many things to say to you. but before I do, I want you to know that I don't hate you anymore. I used to resent you; you broke my heart.
		<p> Seeing the Man of my life, as a child , leaving; killed me. Was I not good enough? Was it my fault? Questions that run through my mind after you left. Not trusting guys, thinking everyone will walk out on me, anxiety; these were just few things I dealt with because of you.
		<p> I used to wonder, What would it feel like to have a Dad who reads bedtime stories to me before sleep? What would it feel like to have a Dad who scares all of the guys who'll try to date me? What would it feel like to have a Dad who puts time and effort in our relationship and never makes me feel unloved by him? What would it feel like if YOU didn't leave?
		<p> By my teenage years. I understood enough why you and Momma fought. You two were just victims of love. I know you did not leave with the intention of hurting me nor my sisters. But it did. A lot. And from time to time, I've come to realize that it's just a waste of time to hate you. And I've accepted it. And as an adult now, I would like to genuinely thank you.
		<p>Thank you for bringing me into this world,
        <br>Thank you for letting me see how amazing and strong Momma is. Being a single parent, playing both parts of parenting and still being so remarkable and caring 24/7. It was amazing to watch while growing up.. It showed me what it means to love someone and will do everything for them,
		<p>Thank you, because of you, I'm a stronger individual. I'm a wiser person when it comes to relationships now. I don't believe in everything I hear because you were the king of lies, but it helps. Not trusting everyone. If you never left, I wouldn't be who I am today.
		<p>You leaving made me realize one thing, that not everything works out and that's okay.
			You leaving taught me a lot of life lessons at a young age.
			So, I mean it when I say I don't resent you anymore. Yes, I love you and of course I still miss you from time to time. Sometimes I look at old photographs of us and realize the scar you left will never disappear. But after all these years I can say, genuinely, I forgive you. After all, Dads suppose to make their daughters strong, and that's exactly what you did to me. And if there's a chance to be with you, so be it. You were and always will be my Dad.
		<p>Sincerely,
		<br>Your Daughter
