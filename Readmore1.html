		<body> <h1> History </h1>
		<p> If history repeats itself, maybe I should have learned already;

		<p> Maybe I just got used with the fact that through the years, you were there when I needed someone who would listen to the things I don't say. The feels that as long as I know you're there, I'm okay. But then I woke up one day, she reminded me about the fact that you are hers now. And it kills me every time I see how your dimples appear whenever she makes you laugh and how your eyes sparkle every time you see her smile.
			But what's constant couldn't be changed anymore. I can still taste the bitterness of yesterday and feels the coldness of your approach.

		<p> Until one day, there’s this guy who made me feel like my heart wasn't broken and let me feel the warm of love again. It was like, the first time.
			I don't see you in his eyes. I couldn't feel your touch in his skin. I couldn't recognize the feel of your love in him but I am sure... that every time I'm with him, I feel so loved and cared. He wasn't like you. He wasn't but I liked him too. I liked him to the point that; I forgot the pain of loving you. He puts the sun in my universe again to brighten the darkness you left me and he's definitely okay about it.
			For him, it’s okay that every time I hear the Harry Potter thingy, it's you that came out my mind first. He likes Harry Potter too, and he’s definitely crazy about it.

		<p> And later on, I've learned to forget that Harry Potter is about you and started embracing the fact that it's about him now. I adore him every day for being okay with the things that I remember about you. It's like; he's fine being my second best. 
			It's selfish I know. But don't worry; he's the first in every list I make now. I just adore his patience about waiting for me to see his worth. 
			He didn't get tired of proving me that he likes me. Yes. He's that weird. I can still remember how he could do acting in front of people just to make me smile. I appreciate his efforts of doing so but the best thing about him? Everything.

		<p> For the nth time, I convinced myself that maybe, he's the real one. Being around him feels like a fairy tale though he doesn't like the idea of those kinds of stories. Yeah, I know. You love fairy tales and he doesn't but it's perfectly not a thing for me. I could see him as my King, but I don't see him as someone with the superhuman gifts because I always see him way better than I did to you.
			He loves reading books too. We could spend hours in the book store, having our own different world reading with a different genre. He has this weird feels every time I rush to the Nicholas Sparks’ corner, teasing me about how weird my taste is. Maybe, he’s right. Weird, because he is one about it.

		<p>I could be the childish me around him without his nerves getting so annoyed over me. But I do, when he does this childish act towards me. I still find it cute though. Well, it feels better to remember the stuffs we used to do together. Maybe that's what distance could do; Long for each other and feel so blue. I always tell you that I want having spaces between us, but it scares me doing it now with him.
			He's clingy and he hates distance. I do now too. It's because, misunderstanding appears between the spaces, between the lines. And it's when fights started to appear in the story. 

		<p> It's now when I believe that history repeats itself. And it's true that pain demands to be felt; that the world is not normal without it. Maybe that is why I have to let it happen.

		<p>Again. I thought, I could handle the same thing now with the best that I can. It happened to me once, I should've used to it by now. But still, it hurts like the first time. Even worse of the pain I've felt because of you. I thought, first heartbreak was the most painful one.

		<p> I didn't know this would also feels like the first time. Maybe that's the only thing that resembles you both. Like you,
